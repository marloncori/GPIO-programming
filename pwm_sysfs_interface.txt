Using PWMs with the sysfs interface

If CONFIG_SYSFS is enabled in your kernel configuration a simple sysfs interface is provided to use the PWMs from userspace. It is exposed at /sys/class/pwm/. Each probed PWM controller/chip will be exported as pwmchipN, where N is the base of the PWM chip. Inside the directory you will find:

    npwm
        The number of PWM channels this chip supports (read-only).
    export
        Exports a PWM channel for use with sysfs (write-only).
    unexport
        Unexports a PWM channel from sysfs (write-only).

The PWM channels are numbered using a per-chip index from 0 to npwm-1.

When a PWM channel is exported a pwmX directory will be created in the pwmchipN directory it is associated with, where X is the number of the channel that was exported. The following properties will then be available:

    period
        The total period of the PWM signal (read/write). Value is in nanoseconds and is the sum of the active and inactive time of the PWM.
    duty_cycle
        The active time of the PWM signal (read/write). Value is in nanoseconds and must be less than the period.
    polarity
        Changes the polarity of the PWM signal (read/write). Writes to this property only work if the PWM chip supports changing the polarity. The polarity can only be changed if the PWM is not enabled. Value is the string “normal” or “inversed”.
    enable

        Enable/disable the PWM signal (read/write).

                0 - disabled
                1 - enabled
